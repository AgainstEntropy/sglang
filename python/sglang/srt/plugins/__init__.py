"""
SGLang Unified Plugin Framework.

Supports two types of plugins via setuptools entry_points:
1. Hardware Platform Plugins (sglang.platform_plugins) - register custom hardware platforms
2. General Plugins (sglang.plugins) - inject hooks into functions/methods, replace classes, etc.

Plugins are discovered automatically when installed via pip.
- Platform plugins: use ``SGLANG_PLATFORM`` to select when multiple are installed.
- General plugins: use ``SGLANG_PLUGINS`` (comma-separated) to restrict which are loaded.
